# Boy

The medieval alleyway was narrow and dark, the cobblestones slick with recent rain. Twelve-year-old Scoat huddled against the cold stone wall, his brown hair falling into his blue eyes as he tried to make himself smaller.

"Well, well, look what we have here," a harsh voice cut through the damp air.

Scoat's heart sank. Three older boys blocked the alley's entrance, their shadows stretching long in the fading afternoon light. The leader, a burly teenager with a cruel sneer, cracked his knuckles.

"The little orphan thinks he can hide from us," the leader taunted, stepping forward. "You owe us protection money, runt."

"I don't have anything," Scoat whispered, his voice trembling.

The leader grabbed Scoat by the collar, lifting him effortlessly. "Then you'll pay with your hide instead."

The first punch sent pain exploding across Scoat's jaw. He stumbled back against the wall, tasting blood. Another blow caught him in the stomach, stealing his breath. The third boy joined in, kicking his legs out from under him.

Curled in a ball on the cold ground, Scoat felt despair wash over him. No one would help him. No one ever did. He was just another abandoned child in a world that had already forgotten him existed.

As the kicks and punches continued, something strange began to happen. A warmth spread through his chest, unlike anything he'd ever felt before. It wasn't the warmth of blood or pain—it was something else, something powerful.

"Please stop," he begged, but his voice was lost in their laughter.

The warmth intensified, flowing down his arms into his hands. He looked down in amazement as a soft blue light began to glow between his palms. The light coalesced, forming into a perfect sphere about the size of an apple.

"What the—?" one of the boys stepped back, eyes wide.

The sphere pulsed with energy, casting an ethereal blue glow across the alley. Scoat could feel its power thrumming through him, responding to his desperate need for protection.

"Magic!" the leader hissed, but his fear was quickly replaced by greed. "Think of what we could do with—"

He never finished his sentence.

Acting on pure instinct, Scoat thrust his hand forward. The blue sphere shot through the air, striking the leader square in the chest. The boy flew backward as if hit by a battering ram, crashing into the wall with a sickening thud and sliding to the ground unconscious.

The remaining two bullies stared in terror, then turned to flee.

"No," Scoat whispered, and another sphere appeared in his other hand. This one was smaller, faster. He sent it flying toward the first boy, then another toward the second. Both went down without a sound.

Silence descended upon the alley. Scoat stood slowly, his body aching but his mind clear. He looked at his hands—his ordinary, dirty hands—that had just produced something extraordinary.

The blue spheres faded, but the warmth remained, a constant presence now just beneath his skin. He was no longer just Scoat, the abandoned orphan boy. He was something more.

Something powerful.

As he walked out of the alley, leaving the unconscious bullies behind, Scoat felt the weight of his old life falling away. The world hadn't changed, but he had. And for the first time in twelve years, he wasn't afraid.

He was ready.

# Boy

The alleyway lay soaked in a thin sheen of rain, its narrow stone walls trapping the last traces of daylight. Twelve-year-old Scoat pressed himself against the cold bricks, trying to quiet his breath. His brown hair clung damply to his forehead, partially veiling the blue eyes that darted anxiously toward the alley’s entrance.

A harsh voice broke the silence.

"Well, well… look what we have here."

Three older boys stepped into view, their figures stretching long across the wet cobblestones. The leader—broad-shouldered, older, and wearing a familiar cruel grin—approached first.

“The little orphan thinks he can hide,” he taunted. “You owe us protection money.”

“I… I don’t have anything,” Scoat murmured.

The leader grabbed him by the collar and lifted him with ease. Pain exploded through Scoat’s jaw as the first punch landed. Another followed. A kick sent him collapsing onto the cold ground. The other two joined in, boots and fists striking without hesitation.

He curled into himself, trembling and hurting, unable to fight back.  
*No one will help me… no one ever helps me.*

But in the rising haze of despair, something stirred.

A warmth.  
Small at first—barely noticeable—but growing brighter, stronger.

“Please… stop…” Scoat whispered, though the boys only laughed.

The warmth surged. It spread through his chest, down his arms, gathering in his hands. A faint blue glow spilled between his fingers.

“What—what is that?” one of the boys stammered.

A perfect blue sphere hovered between Scoat’s palms, humming with energy. The alley lit up with an ethereal glow.

The leader’s shock twisted into greed.  
“Magic… he’s using magic!”

Instinct overtook fear.

Scoat thrust his hand forward.

The sphere launched with blinding speed, slamming into the leader’s chest. The impact sent him flying backward into the stone wall. The thud echoed through the alley as he slid down unconscious.

The remaining two boys tried to flee, but Scoat’s fear had already transformed into something else—clarity.

Another sphere formed instantly in his hand—smaller, sharper.

Two flashes of blue.  
Two bodies hitting the ground.

Silence reclaimed the alley.

Scoat rose slowly, chest heaving. The glow around his hands faded to a soft shimmer, but the warmth remained—steady, alive.

He stared at his palms.  
*This power… was inside me all along?*

He stepped out of the alley, leaving the fallen bullies behind. For the first time in his twelve years of life, his fear had vanished.

He was no longer just a forgotten orphan.  
He was something else now.

Something powerful.
